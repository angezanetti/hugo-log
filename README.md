## Content type

You can specify content type with field `type` in your content. For example static pages can be set as type `page` which are excluded from recent posts and all posts page. You can use site params `mainSections` and `disableDisqusTypes` to control which page types are excluded from recent posts and Disqus comments respectively.

```md
---
title: My Title
date: 2020-11-13T09:40:23-04:00
description: My description
draft: false
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---

This is some static page where you can write about yourself.
```

## Language Settings for the month

Due to the currently unavailable feature for multilingual dates in `.Date` from
Go. It is possible to create a `month.yaml` in the data folder of your
Hugo site root directory. There is also an example file in
`exampleSite/data/`.

```sh
cat > month.yaml << EOF
1: "Jan"
2: "Feb"
3: "Mar"
4: "Apr"
5: "May"
6: "Jun"
7: "Jul"
8: "Aug"
9: "Sep"
10: "Oct"
11: "Nov"
12: "Dec"
EOF
```
